- set theory er differnce e jodi A U B hoy tahole must A er ja ja milbe tai bad dite hobe 
- A⊆B   means B is a subset of A .
- Empty set is a subset of every set .
- Number of ways to arrange n distinct objects n! = n*(n-1) *1
- For Calculating GCD i have take the common value of those number (not repeated value is allowed)
- implecation : Statement:
"If it is raining, then the ground is wet."

If it is raining and the ground is wet → statement is true.

If it is raining but the ground is not wet → statement is false (contradiction).

If it is not raining, the statement says nothing definite about the ground, so the implication is true regardless of whether the ground is wet or dry.


================
An implecation p-->q is false only if p is ture and q is false
